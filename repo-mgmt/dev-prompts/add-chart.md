# Add A Chart

I'd like to add a chart to this repository to track the growth of my collection of Assistant configurations over time. The Assistant configurations are in the Assistant folder. The count of assistants in the repository is equivalent to the number of files contained within the assistants directory recursing through the sub directories. I'd like to update the count of assistants in the repository, But to do so only once per day at the most. The number of assistants is already calculated from a pre hook. I'd like to display a chart showing the Assistants gross over time in the Read Me section just beneath the header image of the sloth. This could be a bar chart with the count on the Y axis and the date on the X axis. Of course, this graph would need to be frequently overwritten. This repository is displayed on Github, so it should work on this platform.

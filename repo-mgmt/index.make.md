# Index Instructions

Generate a script which should run automatically every time the repository is pushed. Its purpose is to iterate through the files in the assistants folder and update an index which should be in the Readme file.

The index should list all the assistants in reverse chronological order - starting with the most recently created and working through to the last. 

The format of the markdown table should be: Assistant name (prettified), Creation Date, URL

The URL should be a markdown badge linking  to the assistant configuration in the repository (it should resolve on Github)
